AI Projects by Yossef Ezzalden
Welcome to my AI project repository For my project on DEPI! Each project demonstrates a different aspect of AI, including supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and advanced modeling techniques.

1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
2. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
4. Ensemble Models
5. Monte Carlo Simulation
